# Information for the Biology and Environmental Analysis majors

## Biology

Within Biology, we do not at present offer tracks. However, students can and have selected [courses within the major](https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/biology/academic-program/biology-courses-and-requirements) that allow them to further explore their interests in conservation biology, organismal biology, ecology, genomic techniques for environmental biology, etc.

## Environmental Analysis

The EA major requires students to decide on a [track, each of which has a separate course plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chchang47/PomonaAdvising/main/EA%20COURSE%20PLAN%20COMPREHENSIVE.pdf).

# Considerations for majoring in Biology and/or EA

In general, I do not recommend and I do not think it is possible, following College guidelines, for a student to double major in Biology and EA Biology as that would require double-counting upper and lower-division courses. However, if students are interested in a non-biological course plan within EA and also seek to develop biological knowledge, then a **non-Bio EA track** could be appropriate to pursue alongside the Biology major.
